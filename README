Introduction:
=============
This library (CoreLibrary) is a collection of useful C++11 utility classes to
assist with multi-threading, logging, networking, custom exceptions, file
utilities, INI files, serialization, sorting, string utilities and so on.
It is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License and the relevant
documentation for this can be found at the top of each source file and in the
files COPYING and COPYING.LESSER.

The code is the work of Duncan Crutchley
(duncan.crutchely+corelibrary@gmail.com).

Requirements:
=============
This library has been developed in Qt Creator for Windows and Linux. In Windows
it is recommended to use the MSVC2015 32bit and 64bit tool chain from within Qt
Creator to build and test the code. However, other compilers have been tested
in Windows such as Clang 3.8+ and GCC (MinGW) 4.8.X+. In Linux the code has
been tested with GCC 4.8.X+ and Clang 3.8+.

The projects supplied for the library and unit tests are for Qt Creator and
will work in Linux and Windows. To achieve this the projects rely on the custom
mkspecs to be copied from the qt_custom_mkspecs folder into Qt's appropriate
mkspec feature folder, e.g. <...>\Qt\5.8\msvc2015_64\mkspecs\features. Example
mkspecs are provided for compatibility with MSVC2015 32 bit and 64bit and Linux.

These should be customized for the user's own system.

You may use this code within other development and build environments but it is
up to the user to create the required projects or makefiles for those
environments. This should be fairly easy by referring to the Qt project (.pro)
file and the previously mentioned mkspec files.

This library requires some third-party open source libraries for it to compile
and function. These are as follows:

- Boost (tested with 1.57+ but newest version recommended):
  http://www.boost.org/

- Cereal (tested with 1.2.1+ but newest version recommended):
  http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/

- Loki:

- Google Test (tested with 1.7.0+, but newest recommended):

Notes:
======
This is largely a hobby project based on the knowledge I've gained in my many
years of experience working in software development and academia. I started
the development of this code in early 2014. This represents a collection of,
hopefully, straightforward to use and useful classes for commonly occurring
software development needs.

All the code has been unit tested and I've used this code in my own projects
without issue. I also have used much of this code and similar code written by
me in commercial projects, often with (soft) real-time requirements, and have
not had any issues so feel free to use this in commercial projects as long as
you adhere to the license.

I fix bugs and improve the code as and when necessary but make no guarantees
on how often this happens. I provide no warranty or support for any issues that
are encountered while using it. Although if you are really stuck email me at
the provided address and if I have the time I will try to help/fix the issue if
it's within my power.
The code is commented using Doxygen style comments so check the documentation
in the /docs/html/ folder and open index.html in your browser of choice.

For usage examples I recommend looking at the unit test code in the
/UnitTests/GoogleTests folder.

The networking unit tests require network connectivity and expect 2 adapters
setup, one on 160.50.100.76/255.255.0.0 and another on
160.51.100.76/255.255.0.0. These can be "virtual" loop-back adapters or physical
network adapters.
